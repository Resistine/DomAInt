GREYCORTEX Research DomAInt is an open extension of Chrome and Firefox browsers, which classifies bad domains without sending your data anywhere. 

It is the first browser add-on based on Artificial Intelligence, created as a toy based on white and black lists of our product Mendel and a 
new platform for sharing cybersecurity information using Artificial Intelligence ThreAInt, which are humorously pre-processed using own alphabets 
and dictionaries and classified by neural networks using TensorFlow.js.
